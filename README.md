# Gartenzwergli
*Your simple gardening companion app*

## Functionality
The *Gartenzwergli* App can provide information about different crops for your everyday garden.
A user can search for crops, find companion plants and can find out how long it takes for a crop to be harvested.
Additionaly a calendar for all the users crops can be managed on the Homepage. 
The status of each plant is shown on the calendar and the user is able to set notifications for a day when the crop is ready to be harvested.
The app also keeps track of a users garden and which crops belong to which gardening bed, to keep everything organised.
